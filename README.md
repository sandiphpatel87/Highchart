Interactive Pie Charts in Salesforce LWC using Highcharts
This repository demonstrates how to create interactive pie charts in a Lightning Web Component (LWC) using the Highcharts library. The implementation allows users to switch between multiple datasets dynamically and visualize data in an engaging and interactive way.

Features
Dynamic Pie Charts: Switch between multiple datasets using a dropdown menu.
Responsive Design: Charts automatically adjust to fit the container size.
Customizable: Easily add or modify datasets and chart configurations.

Prerequisites
Salesforce Org with My Domain enabled.

Setup Instructions
1. Upload Highcharts as a Static Resource
Download the Highcharts library from the official website.
In Salesforce, go to Setup â†’ Static Resources â†’ New.
Upload the Highcharts file (e.g., highcharts.js) and name it Highcharts.
Save the static resource.

2. Deploy the LWC Component
Clone this repository or copy the code into your Salesforce environment.
Deploy the following files to your Salesforce org:
JavaScript File: interactivePieCharts.js
HTML File: interactivePieCharts.html
Meta XML File: interactivePieCharts.js-meta.xml

3. Add the Component to a Lightning Page

Create or edit a Lightning Page (App Page, Record Page, or Home Page).
Drag and drop the interactivePieCharts component onto the page.
Save and activate the page.
